  Welcome to JavaScript BootCamp!!! Today, we will learn basic methods and how to input your script into HTML documents!!!

First, we need to open our code writer. On my Mac, I use TextEdit. On my Windows, I use Notepad ++. Now, type this into the document

print

The command 'print' tells JavaScript to "print" the page. For instance, go to a website, try google.co.uk, and open your JavaScript
Console (I will say js.console mostly) and type:

print

You will see the print screen to print the page. Now, I will introduce this type of code,

var myName=GamerOnGitHUb
document.write(myName)

The command 'var' tells JavaScript that the fallowing text in this line is a variable and needs to be remembered.
The command 'document.write' tells JavaScript to write this onto the page and '(myName)' can also be changed to '(GamerOnGitHub)'the '()'
is used to define the text to be distributed.


That is all for this tutorial, stay tuned for more tutorials on JavaScript and more programming languages.
